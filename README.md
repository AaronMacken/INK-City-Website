# INK-City-Website

This website is a portfolio project created using MongoDB, Express, Node and NPM. The majority of the CSS is custom built,
except for a few third party frameworks to assist with animations and scrolling. 

The site is similar to pinterest in that it acts as a social media site where you can sign up and add friends.
The site demonstrates CRUD functionality via the add / remove friends feature & the update profile information options.

The site uses a third party API (juicer) to dynamically load in instagram posts. Originally the plan was to add CRUD
functionality based off of the API's return data, but juicer charges a fee of $20 a month to have full reign over the API's
returned data. So for now the site shall remain incomplete in that aspect. 

The site is merely a demonstration of web development ability and is not intended for actual use.
